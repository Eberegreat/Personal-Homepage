with your guidance, i'd like to build a personal homepage using HTML and CSS.
please note that i'll only request specific code snippets as we progress, so there's 
no need to provide code untill explicitly ask for it. do you understand? 

// HTML STRUCTURE 
Help me design a basic HTML structure for a personal homepage.
it should have the following sections: a header, a section for displaying my projects,
an about section and a section for showcasing my skills. Also, include a footer. 

please add these sections as placeholders for now, as we will be coding them and filling them out step by step.
Do you understand?  

// Header and Navigation 
please code an HTML header displaying my name, Chidiebere John, and navigation links for the sections: projects,
about, and skills. 

// About Section 
Now guide me to create the HTML for the about section. it should include 
my picture, a friendly introduction, and a link to my resume. 

// Skills Section
Now let's code the HTML for my skills section

let's start with the skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python. 
Each skill should have a name and a description. i also want to display a 
progress bar representing my proficiency in each skill. 
do you understand? 

//footer
Create the HTML for the page footer. It should contain copyright information and links to my LinkedIn, Twitter,
facebook profiles. please use icon fonts to display a social media icon for each link. 

// CSS Layout and Design 
Next, design a simple modern CSS layout for my homepage.
The layout should be responsive to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

i prefer a black-and-white colour scheme and sans-serif fonts.

make my picture smaler and rounded. please add generous line height and visual space around the content.
